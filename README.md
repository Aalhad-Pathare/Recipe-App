# Recipe-App
Using APIs to create a functional application

For my next project, I wanted to move away from using these as exploratory projects, and owrk on something that I could use everyday. As a college student with very little free time and a big stomach to fill, I was always confused about which recipes to try and make and wouldn't be confident enough to try new things, and would therefore end up making the same four things over and over again. Which is why I decided to make a recipe generator that uses a databses and an API to prompt a random recipe to me. Adding functionalities such as the ability to search, highlight prep time, and store favorites made this a very practical project and I use it freqeuently when I'm lacking creative culinary motivation.
